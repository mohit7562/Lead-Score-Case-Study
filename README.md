# Lead-Score-Case-Study
Model built to find hot leads using logistic regression.
Company gets its leads from various sources and origins but they are facing issue of low conversion rate. Out of large number of leads that they get the leads whoc are converted are low in number. Initially the conversion rate is around 38%. Company wants to identify the hot leads in order to increase their conversion rate upto 80%.

WE build a logistic regression model to assing a lead score to the leads. Higher the lead score greater are the chances of lead getting converted whereas lower lead score indicates lower chances of conversion.
